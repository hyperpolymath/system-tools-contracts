Roadmap for defining stable seams across AmbientOps.

== Phase 0 — Bootstrap

Deliverables:

* Repo skeleton: `schemas/`, `examples/`, `tests/`, `docs/`
* Contract change policy: what is breaking vs non-breaking
* Versioning scheme (semver)

== Phase 1 — Initial contract set (v0.1)

Deliverables:

* Schema: System Weather payload
* Schema: Evidence Envelope
* Schema: Procedure Plan
* Spec: Run Bundle layout (folder + filenames)
* Schema: Receipt (machine-readable) + human template conventions
* Schema: Message Intent (feedback-a-tron)

Include:

* at least one example per contract in `examples/`
* at least one conformance test per contract in `tests/`

== Phase 2 — Capability tags + profile gates

Deliverables:

* Capability taxonomy (e.g., `net.dns`, `disk.tidy.preview`, `security.firewall`)
* Audience/profile gates (general/dev/technician) as contract vocabulary
* Risk class vocabulary (safe/guided/expert)
* Redaction profiles (minimal/standard/max) and attachment rules

== Phase 3 — Catalog manifests (optional but recommended)

Deliverables:

* Module manifest schema (packs/adapters/themes metadata)
* Compatibility matrix generation inputs (OS/arch/profile)
* Stable deep-link intent format (Ward → A&E/Theatre/Records)

== Phase 4 — Stabilisation

Deliverables:

* Contract test harness usable by all repos (CI integration)
* Backwards compatibility notes and migration guides
* Public “contract status” table (what’s stable, what’s provisional)
